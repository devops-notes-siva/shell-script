RHEL-9-DevOps-Practice - DevOps321

When we say a script is idempotent or non-idempotent, we're describing how the script behaves when run multiple times. Idempotence refers to the property that executing a script multiple times will have the same effect as executing it once. Non-idempotent scripts, on the other hand, may produce different results with each execution or cause unintended side effects.

By nature, shell scripts are non-idempotent.

Devops responsibility to reduce manual tasks & make automation
achievements ---> 1) fast  release 2) reduce the defects


if unable to push the local commits to central git hub
  -> windows -> credential manager -> delete github account
while pushing repo use peronsla access token 
    -> github -> settings -> developer actions -> personal access token
our git info in local system -> user -> .git config

$ git add . ;git commit -m "some msg" ;git push -u origin main

Shell Script
---------------
1st line -->#!/bin/bash

shebang is the location interpreter, commands written inside shell script is interpreted and executed by this shebang

zshell
kshell
cshell
fish

bash shell == shell

how to execute shell script
---------------------
sh <script>
bash <script>
./<script-name> --> this should have execute permission
X --> running the command/script

variables:
-------------
1. repeated words
2. if you want to change, you have to change it every where
3. while changing accidently you may change actual code

arguments/parameters
--------------------
sh variables.sh Raheem Robert

Raheem = 1st variable
Robert = 2nd variable
.
.John = nth variable

DATA TYPES:
------------
In shell script data types not importanat and it can automatically converts


integer
float
decimal
string
boolean --> true/false ... 1=true, 0=false
array
arraylist
set, map

array --> list of values
if you define a variable as array, it can hold list of values...

List always starts with 0

$VARIBALE
${VARIBALE}

+, -, *, / , %

if id is 0 then super user, if not 0 then normal user

disadvantage of shell script
------------------------
shell script will not stop even it faces the error, it is user responsibility to check the previous command is success/not

exit status
------------
what is exit status?

$? --> to check the exit status of previous command
0 --> success
other than 0 --> failure

systemctl is-active --quiet nginx
  If nginx is running, the exit status is 0, and there's no output.
  If nginx is not running, the exit status is 3, and no output is displayed.
